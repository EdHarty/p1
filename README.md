User Stories - 

First-Time User: As a first time user, I want to know more about the Child and Educational Psychologist. I want to know more about the services on offer (assessments and interventions). I want to get a feel of what to expect from each of the different services on offer. 

Returning User: As a returning user, I want to know if any additional services are on offer. I want to find the Child and Educational Psychologist on social media (e.g. twitter and facebook). I want to be able to complete a registration form so that the Child and Educational Psychologist can get in touch with me.

I want user to get a feel for the range psychological disorders that I offer therapeutic interventions for e.g anxiety, deptression, insomnia. As the site owner, I want parents and caregivers to be able to contact me. As the site owner, I want staff from primary and secondary schools to be able to contact me in addition to external parties (e.g. GP). 


Design 

Design Choices: The webpage was designed with the calming feeling a child and/or adolescent might get while attending the Child and Educational Psychologist. The site is a sanctuary for parents and/or caregivers to reach out and seek support.  

Colour: I wanted a plain and simple, yet professional and clinical colour scheme for the website. Initially, from the wireframes I chose an image that I liked at the time and incorporated the colour scheme from that image. But, as the project evolved, I found more free and suitable images on sites such as Pexels. The colour scheme was built around that.

Fonts: I experimented with several different font combinations. My preferred choice was Oswald, in combination with Roboto as a font choice. I wanted to keep these fonts throughout because they contribute to a good UX.

Structure: The website is simple in design and user friendly. The website has three pages. Page 1 is a Welcome Page with a brief overview of the Child and Educational Psychologist. Page 2 is a Services Page. Page 3 is a Contact Page. Different hero images were used to differentiate each of the pages along with different sub-sections and form.

The performance of the website was tested using Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools. I firstly generated a report for a mobile device:

Then I generated a report for desktop:

Performing Tests on Various Devices:
The website was tested on the following devices:

Desktop Computer. 
I-Pad. 
I-Phone. 
Android Phone. 

Browser Compatability:
I tested it on the Google Chrome Browser, the Microsoft Edge Browser and Mozilla Firefox. 


Bugs:
The Welcome page was not aligning properly when viewed on a mobile device. I looked back through my style.CSS file and found that I was missing a semi-colon. Once I added this, it aligned properly. There are currently two bugs that I have not been able to successfully rectify. One is when the services page is viewed on a mobile device the cover text does not align to the left as it does with my welcome and contact pages. Another is that the register button does not function properly. I have put a register icon in place so that when it is clicked upon the user is directed to a g-mail sign up account. 

Deployment 

I used the video provided on the LMS to navigate my way through git hub to deploy my website and make it public. the link is below:
