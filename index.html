        <p>Hi, I'm Lisa, a committed and motivated Child and Educational Psychologist and a member of the Psychological Society of Ireland. I specialise in educational psychology assessments for children and adolescents. For years, I have supported children in preschools, primary schools and secondary schools. My diverse experiences to date have allowed me to gain direct experience in educational and healthcare settings. Get in touch today and let the journey begin.</p>

            <h2>Anxiety</h2>
            <h3>At times, anxiety can impact how your child thinks, how they feel in their mind and body, and what they do (actions and behaviours). When anxiety interferes with their home, school and social life, this is when professional help from a Child and Educational Psychologist may be needed.</h3>

            <h2>Depression</h2>
            <h3>Does your child experience persistent feelings of sadness and exhibit a loss of interest in activites? Has it caused emotional, physical and functional problems? If so, psychological treatment may help ease depressive symptoms for most children and adolescents.</h3>

        <div>
            <h2>Sleep</h2>
            <h3>At times, your child may struggle with sleep and nightmares. Professional help may be needed. With therapy, the Child and Educational Psychologist will provide parents, with strategies to make the night time routine feel more relaxed for their child, and to support the nightmares for example to go away, get smaller and less distressing. </h3>

            <h2>Self-Esteem</h2>
            <h3>At some point, your child may struggle with self-doubt, they may feel unsure or compare themselves negatively with others. When your childâ€™s overall opinion of themselves is negative or critical, and their general sense of their self is poor, professional help may be needed. </h3>
